# Mentora

Mentora is a polished full-stack concept for an AI-powered career blueprint platform built with:

- Vite + React + Tailwind CSS on the frontend
- Express + Mongo-ready models on the backend

## Getting Started

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

In a separate shell:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set environment variables (see `.env.example`) to point the frontend at the API.
